# LibrarySystem
This project is a Library management system which implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing sampled data in a database I created. This project runs in the command line interface (window console) and makes use of the following C++ libraries:
-	stdLib.H – Standard C++ library for features such as delete
-	iostream – Standard C++ library
-	string – string type 
-	iomanip – Formating output (setting widths of columns etc)
-	fstream – reading and writing to files
-	regex – format validation
-	mysql_connection – database connection for mysql c++ connector 
- Several c++ connector classes used for database management (e.g. exception library for error handling)

I made use of the mysql version 9.X.X and MySQL Connector library to be able to use the C++ language to create SQL statements.
Key Features:
-	Authentication
-	MySQL Database Connectivity:
-	Error Handling:
-	Crud Operations:
-	Search functionality: Gives the ability to search for specific users and Titles
-	File reading/writing: reads from the database and writes to a text file based on search parameters
